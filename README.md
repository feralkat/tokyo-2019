This small joint literally translates to "meat sushi"—as exepected, we had horse sashimi (aka **basashi**), as well as raw chicken! I enjoyed the many ways they prepared basashi: nigiri, sashimi, negitoro, marinated, etc. I also recommend the cured egg yolks.

Famous fluffy pancake chain! I tried the berry pancakes. Definitely good, but was more dense than I expected.

Cozy coffee shop with a beautiful interior. The pourover was decent.

Fairly standard gyoza joint. Lots of seating.

Really great yakitori place, one of my favorite meals. They have an English menu, but ordering may be difficult if you're uncomfortable speaking Japanese. 💸 Cash only!
